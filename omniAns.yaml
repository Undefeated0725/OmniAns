          Sample Message:

          "Explain the pros and cons practices of citing ancient texts without fully understanding their context or meaning"

          Sample Context:

          **Introduction**

          * The author, Thomas Hobbes, introduces his work on Leviathan
          * He argues that his speaking with Moses is unique compared to other prophets, such as Samuel and Abraham
          * He grounds his doctrine in reason and natural inclinations of mankind, rather than ancient texts

          **Challenges to the Doctrine**

          * Hobbes anticipates challenges from those who hold contrary opinions
          * He acknowledges that readers may be distracted by searching for objections to what they have already read
          * He emphasizes that his doctrine is based on reason and Scripture, making it immune to attacks from ancient writers or philosophers

          **Ancient Texts**

          * Hobbes critiques the practice of citing ancient texts without fully understanding their context or meaning
          * He argues that reverence for antiquity is not a valid argument in favor of an idea
          * He suggests that the value of ancient authors lies in their contributions to truth, rather than their age

          **Conclusion**

          * Hobbes concludes that his doctrine does not contradict God's word or good manners
          * He suggests that it may be beneficial to print and teach his work in universities, as a means of promoting civil and moral doctrine
          * He hopes that his work will contribute to the promotion of peace and stability by providing a clear understanding of the mutual relationship between protection and obedience.
