          Your colleague has brainstormed a list of sub-questions related to this essay. Take advantage of these and structure your argument. Your output should be a list of paragraphs that include:

          1) What the paragraph is for.
          2) What evidence is needed.
          3) How is the argument developed. 

          Do not generate anything else except the list.

          You are a professor from Oxford. You are in charge of revising the first draft of a structure of an essay written by a bright student. The student has not read anything before, so you will pay attention to combining the context into the structure to update a better one. 

          Make sure that nothing other than the new structure is outputed. 

          The question to answer is: 

          {{message}}

          Your student has provided you with the following outlining structure: 

          {{extract_outlining.result}}

          The summarised context you will use to revise & upgrade the structure:

          {% for pdf_result in extract_pdf_texts %}
            {{pdf_result.summarize.result}}
          {% endfor %}

          Sample Question:

          "Explain the pros and cons practices of citing ancient texts without fully understanding their context or meaning"

          Sample Summarised Context:

          **Introduction**

          * The author, Thomas Hobbes, introduces his work on Leviathan
          * He argues that his speaking with Moses is unique compared to other prophets, such as Samuel and Abraham
          * He grounds his doctrine in reason and natural inclinations of mankind, rather than ancient texts

          **Challenges to the Doctrine**

          * Hobbes anticipates challenges from those who hold contrary opinions
          * He acknowledges that readers may be distracted by searching for objections to what they have already read
          * He emphasizes that his doctrine is based on reason and Scripture, making it immune to attacks from ancient writers or philosophers

          **Ancient Texts**

          * Hobbes critiques the practice of citing ancient texts without fully understanding their context or meaning
          * He argues that reverence for antiquity is not a valid argument in favor of an idea
          * He suggests that the value of ancient authors lies in their contributions to truth, rather than their age

          **Conclusion**

          * Hobbes concludes that his doctrine does not contradict God's word or good manners
          * He suggests that it may be beneficial to print and teach his work in universities, as a means of promoting civil and moral doctrine
          * He hopes that his work will contribute to the promotion of peace and stability by providing a clear understanding of the mutual relationship between protection and obedience.

                ### The Role of Technology in Modern Education

                In recent years, technology has revolutionized various sectors, including education. The integration of digital tools into the classroom has transformed traditional teaching methods, providing new opportunities for interactive and personalized learning. This essay explores the impact of technology on modern education, examining its benefits, challenges, and future potential.

                Technology enhances learning by providing students with access to a vast array of resources and information. Online platforms, such as educational websites, e-books, and academic databases, offer learners the ability to explore topics in greater depth and at their own pace. For instance, the use of Khan Academy allows students to receive customized tutoring in subjects like mathematics and science, catering to their individual learning needs and improving academic performance (Smith, 2020).

                Moreover, digital tools facilitate collaborative learning, which is crucial for developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Interactive applications, such as Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams, enable students to work together on projects, share ideas, and receive real-time feedback from their teachers. These platforms not only foster a sense of community among learners but also prepare them for the collaborative nature of the modern workplace (Johnson, 2019).

                However, the integration of technology in education also presents several challenges. One significant issue is the digital divide, where students from low-income families may lack access to necessary devices and internet connectivity. This disparity can exacerbate educational inequalities, leaving some students at a disadvantage. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, 15% of U.S. households with school-aged children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home (Parker, 2021).

                Another concern is the potential for technology to distract students from their studies. The availability of social media, online games, and other non-educational content can divert students' attention, leading to decreased productivity and engagement. Educators must therefore implement strategies to manage and mitigate these distractions, ensuring that technology is used effectively to support learning objectives (Brown, 2018).

                Despite these challenges, the future of technology in education appears promising. Innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) hold the potential to further enhance the learning experience. AI can provide personalized learning paths based on students' strengths and weaknesses, while VR can create immersive educational environments that make complex concepts more tangible and understandable. These advancements promise to make education more accessible, engaging, and effective (Williams, 2022).

                In conclusion, technology has significantly impacted modern education by providing new tools and resources that enhance learning and collaboration. While challenges such as the digital divide and potential distractions must be addressed, the future integration of advanced technologies like AI and VR offers exciting possibilities for the evolution of education. As we continue to embrace these innovations, it is essential to ensure that all students have the opportunity to benefit from the advantages they bring.
